# Simple-TFQuantum
This is a simple Expample classification model to compare the performane of Tensorflow Quantum models and hybrid Quantum/classical model. Single layer classical dense network is also included to check the performance.

DataHandler.py file genrates simple binary class data (arranged in simple shapes like circle and triangle) and emcodes it into qBits and quantum circuits.
TFQuantum_classification.py file trains the quantum cirucit and compares it with the hybrid, classical model.

run the TFQuantum_classification.py file to train and test the models.

Libraries used:
  1.Tensorflow Quantum 0.4.0
